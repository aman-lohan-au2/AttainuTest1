  (1) Forward proxy connection initiates from insidesecured zone and distributed       Reverse Proxy connection comed from oiutside global network and destined to inside secure network. 
to outside unsecured global network.
(2)  Forward Proxy are not used for Application Delivery                                Reverse proxy are built for application delivery
(3) Forward Proxy are good for content filtering,Netting,Email Security etc             It is used for load balancing Content Switching,Authentication and application firewall.
(4) Forward Proxy restrict the internal user from accessing for user filtered/          it restricted the outside user/client to have direct access to internal/private network.
