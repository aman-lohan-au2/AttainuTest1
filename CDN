CDN:-A CDN is a network of computers that delivers content.
 More specifically, it's a bunch of servers geographically positioned between the origin server of some web content, and
the user requesting it, all with the purpose of delivering the content faster by reducing latency.

WORk:- CDN puts your content in many places at once, providing superior coverage to your users. For example, when someone in London accesses your US-hosted website, it is done through a local UK PoP. This is much quicker than having the visitorâ€™s requests, and your responses, travel the full width of the Atlantic and back.
