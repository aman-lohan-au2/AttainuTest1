   Normalization                                          Denormnalization
(1) It is process of create set scheme to store        It is process of combining data so that it cane be
   non redundant dataand consistant data               Querid speedly 
(2) To reduce the data redundancy and inconsistency    It achieve the faster execution of the queries through introducing redundancy
(3)Data integrity is maintained                        It may not retain.
(4)Redundancy Eliminated                               Redundancy added.
(5) tables increase                                    tables decrease. 
(6) Disk space optimize usage                          disk space wastage.
